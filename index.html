I guess what we could do is define the problem by showing you some numbers and statistics, while going through an assortment of arbitrary graphs, while trying to theoretically prove some fundamental issue in your system. But we think we might just end up being like buzz lightyear here * So instead, we thought we'd start by introducing you to some of our friends. You may have already met them.</aside>

                    <aside class="notes">In addition, as expressed by Fred, we noticed that along the way, the Inland Revenue website had an abundance of useful information regarding every step of the task being completed. However, the problem was that it was often disconnected to the context that the user was currently in, making it difficult to find said useful information. Once we realized this, we started to brainstorm ways in which we could take advantage of this fundamental characteristic of the website, and try to link the flow chart nature of the website, along with making context specific information readily available. Which brought a solution to which we refer to as "The Guided Flowchart Navigation" approach</aside>

                    <img src="images/app/flow.png" style="width: auto; height: 400px; border: none; background: none; box-shadow: none;">

                    <aside class="notes">Ok, so lets take you through our rational on how we generate this Guided Flowchart. Firstly we take the initial steps on identifying what it is you are trying to accomplish, and break that down into a flowchart. For instance, Applying for an IRD number. Next we take the actual forms to complete, and break those down into flowcharts. Lets link them up. So now we have a consistent stream in which a consumer just needs to follow, eventually making it to the forms they need to complete, and actually completing the form.</aside>

                        <div class="pres-overlay">
                            <div class="pres1 pres-flow1"></div>
                            <div class="pres2 pres-flow2"></div>
                            <div class="pres3 pres-flow3"></div>
                            <div class="pres4 pres-flow4"></div>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <aside class="notes">Giving us something like this. If you look down at the iPhones we have given you, you can have a play yourself. Now it's not a working application, but just by swiping across, you can get a feel for what the "Guided Flowchart Navigation" experience will be like.</aside>

                    <aside class="notes">Finally, while we were exploring the flowchart structure, we noticed that it was very easy to link up specific help information to a particular section the user was currently on. So we tried thinking of a way we could tie this information into the general flow of the app.</aside>
                </section>

                <section class="quick-help-section">
                    <div class="pres-iphone">

                                <div class="pres-options-cell pres-options-yes">

                                </div>
                                <div class="pres-options-cell pres-options-no">
                                    No
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="pres6-menu-bar"></div>
                            <div class="pres-header"></div>
                            <div class="pres-gesture"></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <span class="quick-help-animation fragment"></span>

                    <aside class="notes">And so Swipe For Help was born. At every step of the way, additional information that is specific to the question in context is at the users fingertips. Literally.</aside>

                    <aside class="notes">Now what was important for us to focus on, was not designing an app for 1 specific user type. For instance this caters very well to the Freds who have very little experience with IRD, but not particularly with the Jane's and Mike's. They, being more well versed with IRD, do not need to go through the initial steps in order to figure out what they are trying to do. They already know. So we had to think of a way to cater to both ends of the spectrum. This is where the Quick Search idea came from</aside>
                </section>

                <section class="quick-search-section">
                    <div class="pres-iphone">
                        <div class="pres-overlay pres-overlay-hidden">
                            <div class="pres7"></div>
                            <div class="pres7-menu-bar"></div>
                            <div class="pres-header"></div>
                            <div class="pres-gesture"></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <span class="quick-search-animation fragment"></span>

                    <aside class="notes">Quick Search basically allows the user to jump to a particular section in the flowchart. We call these "hot spots". Areas of the application that we know are key areas in which a user has to begin to have properly completed a specific task. The way in which we made these "hot spots" is by having a search bar available in the dashboard, the user can quickly type the application name or keywords to get around the app too. In addition we could build a 'popular tasks' section which will auto update based user interaction, or time of the year.</aside>

                <section>
                    <aside class="notes">Similar to the way in which a lot of New Zealand banks are doing with their mobile apps, by registering a specific device to a particular account with a password/PIN, IRD can be more confident that any interactions with our app are coming from a legitimate source, and therefore more readily give our Jane's specific and privileged information.</aside>

                <h2>Communication</h2>

                <aside class="notes">One of the main problems we were trying to address was the communication problems that exist between users and IRD. Not only from the user to IRD, but also from IRD to the user. So we thought to use push notification could be taken advantage of rather than traditional means of communication, which can often be ineffective. We want EasyIR to be the bridge to a healthy relationship between IRD and it's users. And, we all know, like any relationship, we believe that 2 way communication is key to keeping everyone happy chappies.</aside>

                <h2>Dashboard</h2>

                <aside class="notes">Let's face it, when life gets busy, dealing with IRD applications is probably the last thing you want to do. Getting penalized for missing important due dates makes it even worse. If only there was a personal assistant to manage your IRD applications, enquiries and feedback! Well with EasyIR, we came up with the Dashboard to take care of all this for you. When you sign in the Dashboard will be the first thing you see. Giving you a summary of all tasks and applications that are specific to you. This includes completed forms that you can reference, pending tasks that you may have left to complete at a later date, and urgent tasks that require your immediate attention. All of which have a direct connection to the Flowchart, allowing the user to quickly jump to a particular section if they need to.</aside>

                <h2>Modern Lifestyle</h2>

                <aside class="notes">There is also an apparent change in the way that we interact with mobile applications. Not too long ago, we would dedicate a good chunk out of our day to sit down an accomplish a task at hand. Nowadays, we expect to be able to finish anything in a minute, or somewhere close to that. This is the kind of interaction that we had in our mind while deigning the user experience of the application. In addition having the ability to pick up from where you left off.</aside>
